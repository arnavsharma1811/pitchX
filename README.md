# PitchX

PitchX is an AI-powered mock interview platform designed to help candidates practice interviews in a realistic, structured environment and receive actionable feedback on their performance.

The platform simulates real interview flows — from question generation to response evaluation — with a focus on clarity, confidence, and communication rather than rote answers.

## 🚀 What PitchX Does

- Generate mock interviews tailored to roles and experience levels
- Guide users through structured interview sessions
- Capture and analyze responses (text-first, voice-assisted)
- Provide detailed AI-powered feedback on:
  - clarity
  - structure
  - confidence
  - communication quality
- Track performance and improvement over time

PitchX is built as a **practice and evaluation tool**, not a demo — focusing on real interview dynamics and useful feedback.

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

- **UI first, intelligence later** — build clear user flows before layering AI
- **Cost-aware architecture** — avoid unnecessary paid dependencies
- **Signal-based evaluation** — combine transcript analysis with measurable speech signals
- **Product over polish** — usability and clarity over visual excess

## 🎯 Why PitchX

Interviews are high-pressure environments where feedback is often vague or unavailable.  
PitchX aims to make interview preparation **deliberate, measurable, and repeatable** by combining structured practice with AI-assisted evaluation.
